## Why the hell did I come back?

I've decided to come out of hiding, or I should say finally have time in my life to focus
on thing that I care about.

A lot has changed, I left Chicago about 3 months ago to work for [Procore Technologies](https://www.procore.com) whilst living in Santa Barbara, CA... try and make me move back!

### Currently Playing With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) (Vuex / Nuxt.js)
* [Zeit.co's](https://zeit.co) awesome Now & World
* WebGL 3D Rendering
* GraphQL (Relay React.js & Apollo w/ Vue.js)
* Electron (I love this, can't stop building apps!)

### Reading

I have gone nuts learning as much as I can in my free time and have some great resources I used to share personally however will just be easier on here.  In the meantime I cannot recommend enough:

* [Rob Connery's *The Imposters Handbook*](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/)

### What's Next
I plan on writing up a tutorial this evening on how to Deploy a Node.js application (in docker), static site, DNS configuration and how this blog works using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) with Server Side Rendering.

### Side Note
I named this blog `Ryan's Soap Box` as a joke to a co-worker [Evin](https://github.com/evinism) given I always have some "valuable" input.
