## Why the hell did I come back?

I've decided to come out of hiding, or I should say finally have found an amazing job that allows me time in my life to focus on the things that I care about.

A lot has changed, I left Chicago about 3 months ago to work for [Procore Technologies](https://www.procore.com) whilst living in Santa Barbara, CA. This was a huge adjustment for me and I beyond grateful, I knew out west was more my culture fit.  Just try and make me move back to snow!

### Reading

I have gone nuts learning as much as I can in my free time and have some great resources I used to share personally however will just be easier on here.  In the meantime I cannot recommend enough, oh the money I would have paid for this book a few years ago as a pre-interview primer!

* [Rob Connery's *The Imposter's Handbook*](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/)

### What's Next
I have a small love affair at the moment with anything from Zeit.co so I will be writing up a tutorial on how I built this blog, and how much fun it is to deploy static sites, Node.js applications and so, so, much more!

Mostly I will be yelling at the internet, and occasionaly dropping a nugget of wisdom or two.  Oh I am also learning how to sail as I need a Captain Ron backup plan incase this whole internet thing doesn't work out.

### Side Note
I named this blog `Ryan's Soap Box` as a joke to a co-worker [Evin Sellin](https://github.com/evinism) given I always have some "valuable" input.
